        <h1 style="background-color: #e2e0e4; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> *('0')* Koala Facts
            *('0')*</h1>
        <p style="background-color: #e2e0e4; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> Koalas are great. They have
            fluffy ears and are like teddy bears, only they come with a heart <3. </p>
                <p style="background-color: #e2e0e4; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> The word "koala" is
                    thought to originate from one of the Australian Aboriginal languages, Dharug, which
                    roughly translates to ‘no drink’ or ‘no water’. And this might explain why. In the Australian bush,
                    koalas rarely drink water as the majority of their water intake comes from eating fresh eucalyptus
                    leaves. Koalas drinking water is uncommon in the wild, although they can do so if necessary,
                    especially
                    during heat waves, droughts or bushfires</p>
                <p style="background-color: #e2e0e4; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> There is only one
                    species of Koala in the world. It is the only extant member of the family
                    Phascolarctidae, whose closest living relatives are the common wombats. Their wild numbers are
                    estimated
                    to be around 300,000 mature individuals, but showing a declining population trend. Koalas are
                    currently
                    listed as vulnerable by the IUCN.</p>
